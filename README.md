# The Games
The Games of the Games was one of the programs I *made* in either 1991 or 1992 for my [Spectrum +2A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum#ZX_Spectrum_+2A). Indeed, I think I just made a compilation of classic games programmed in [Sinclair BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_BASIC) from different sources (maybe mostly a programming book I purchased at the time).

This compilation includes:
- AJEDREZ, a very simple chess game for two players.
- DACHI, a very simple [Chinese checkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_checkers) for two to six players (and a bit buggy).
- DADOS, a very simple dice game for one player.
- DAMAS, a very simple [checkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts) game for two players.
- DOMINO, a very simple solitaire [dominoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominoes) for one player.
- FRUIT, a simple [slot machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_machine) simulator for one player.
- GO, a very simple [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) game for two players.
- PARED, a very simple [block breaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_clone) game for one player.
- RAYA, a very simple 3D [Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game for two players.
- REVERSI, a very simple [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) game for two players.
